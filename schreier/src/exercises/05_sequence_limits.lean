In this file we manipulate the elementary definition of limits of
sequences of real numbers. 
mathlib has a much more general definition of limits, but here
we want to practice using the logical operators and relations
covered in the previous files.

A sequence u is a function from ℕ to ℝ, hence Lean says
u : ℕ → ℝ
The definition we'll be using is:

-- Definition of « u tends to l »
def seq_limit (u : ℕ → ℝ) (l : ℝ) : Prop :=
∀ ε > 0, ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, |u n - l| ≤ ε

Note the use of `∀ ε > 0, ...` which is an abbreviation of
`∀ ε, ε > 0 → ... `

In particular, a statement like `h : ∀ ε > 0, ...`
can be specialized to a given ε₀ by
  `specialize h ε₀ hε₀`
where hε₀ is a proof of ε₀ > 0.

Also recall that, wherever Lean expects some proof term, we can
start a tactic mode proof using the keyword `by` (followed by curly braces
if you need more than one tactic invocation).
For instance, if the local context contains:

δ : ℝ
δ_pos : δ > 0
h : ∀ ε > 0, ...

then we can specialize h to the real number δ/2 using:
  `specialize h (δ/2) (by linarith)`
where `by linarith` will provide the proof of `δ/2 > 0` expected by Lean.

We'll take this opportunity to use two new tactics:

`norm_num` will perform numerical normalization on the goal and `norm_num at h` 
will do the same in assumption `h`. This will get rid of trivial calculations on numbers,
like replacing |l - l| by zero in the next exercise.

`congr'` will try to prove equalities between applications of functions by recursively 
proving the arguments are the same. 
For instance, if the goal is `f x + g y = f z + g t` then congr will replace it by
two goals: `x = z` and `y = t`.
You can limit the recursion depth by specifying a natural number after `congr'`. 
For instance, in the above example, `congr' 1` will give new goals
`f x = f z` and `g y = g t`, which only inspect arguments of the addition and not deeper.

variables (u v w : ℕ → ℝ) (l l' : ℝ)

-- If u is constant with value l then u tends to l
-- 0033
example : (∀ n, u n = l) → seq_limit u l :=
begin
  sorry
end

/- When dealing with absolute values, we'll use lemmas:

abs_le {x y : ℝ} : |x| ≤ y ↔ -y ≤ x ∧ x ≤ y

abs_add (x y : ℝ) : |x + y| ≤ |x| + |y|

abs_sub_comm (x y : ℝ) : |x - y| = |y - x|

You should probably write them down on a sheet of paper that you keep at 
hand since they are used in many exercises.

-- Assume l > 0. Then u tends to l implies u n ≥ l/2 for large enough n
-- 0034
example (hl : l > 0) : seq_limit u l → ∃ N, ∀ n ≥ N, u n ≥ l/2 :=
begin
  sorry
end

/- 
When dealing with max, you can use

ge_max_iff (p q r) : r ≥ max p q  ↔ r ≥ p ∧ r ≥ q

le_max_left p q : p ≤ max p q

le_max_right p q : q ≤ max p q

You should probably add them to the sheet of paper where you wrote 
the `abs` lemmas since they are used in many exercises.

Let's see an example.

-- If u tends to l and v tends l' then u+v tends to l+l'

seq_limit (u + v) (l + l') :=

  intros ε ε_pos,
  cases hu (ε/2) (by linarith) with N₁ hN₁,

    from hN₁ n (by linarith),  -- note the use of `from`.
                               -- This is an alias for `exact`, 
                               -- but reads nicer in this context 
  have fact₂ : |v n - l'| ≤ ε/2,
    from hN₂ n (by linarith), 
  calc
  |(u + v) n - (l + l')| = |u n + v n - (l + l')|   : rfl
                     ... = |(u n - l) + (v n - l')| : by congr' 1 ; ring
                     ... ≤ |u n - l| + |v n - l'|   : by apply abs_add
                     ... ≤  ε                       : by linarith,
end

In the above proof, we used `have` to prepare facts for `linarith` consumption in the last line.
Since we have direct proof terms for them, we can feed them directly to `linarith` as in the next proof
of the same statement.
Another variation we introduce is rewriting using `ge_max_iff` and letting `linarith` handle the
conjunction, instead of creating two new assumptions.

seq_limit (u + v) (l + l') :=
