# Coxeter diagram
# * - * - * - * - ... - * (n-1) points
# we have x^2 = 1 for each point x
# we have  (xy)^3 = 1 if x - y [connected]
# we have (x y) = 1 if x y  [discnnected]

# Are there other relations other than these?
# there's a map  from G -> Sn -> 1 if G obeys the above relations.
# we want to show that the kernel is 1.
# it's enough to show that |G| <= |Sn|. We already know that the map is onto by the exactness of [G -> Sn -> 1]

# We consider the case for n = 4
# Consider G: a - b - c - d. Consider H = a - b - c. We know by induction that |H| <= |S4| = 24
# If we can show that |G|/|H| <= 5, then |G| <= 120 and we are done.

# We construct the permutation representation of G  on the cosets of H by brute force.


# 1 : point fixed by H. a, b, c âˆˆ H all fix `1`.
# what does `d` do? It must take it to another point `2`.
# so the diagram becomes 1 -d-> 2.
# what does a,b,c do to 2?
# we know that bd = db, or dbd^{-1} = b. So b(2) = dbd^{-1}(2) = db(1) = d(1) = 2.
# similarly, ad = da
